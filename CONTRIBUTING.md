### Contributing to Share Secrets Safely

👍🎉 First off, thanks a lot for taking the time! 🎉👍

In order not to waste it, let's keep things short and simple :).

 1. Write a unit-test or journey test which tests for the desired change.
   * run unitests with `cargo test --all`
   * run journey tests with `make state(less|ful)-journey-tests`
 1. Implement the change so that the tests written above pass.

If you think your changes could be controversial, maybe because it's a feature, please create an issue before to give it some exposure and create a space for discussion. This can be as easy as: `Hey, do you need <my feature>?`, just to prevent unnecessary work.

Thanks again, and happy hacking!
