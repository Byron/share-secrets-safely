## V2.0.0: Better user onboarding experience

### Improvements

 * `vault list` now produces precise URLs
 * `vault recipient add` now signs and re-exports added fingerprints to make
   recipient verification part of adding them, and help build a *Web of Trust*.

### Breaking Changes

The breaking change requiring a major version increment is changes to the `sy-vault.yml` file.

 * The `at` field is now called `secrets`
 * `recipients` and `gpg-keys` paths are no relative to the `sy-vault.yml` file, not relative to the
   `secrets` directory.
 * The '--at/-a' flag of `sy vault` is now `--secrets-dir-dir/-s`
 * `recipients add` will now require fingerprints unless `--verified` is specified.

These improvements make handling paths consistent and less suprising.

## V1.0.1: The very first release - with a new name!

`s3` now officially is `sy` on the command-line, and spelled `sheesy`. Crates
were renamed accordingly, too.

## V1.0.0: The very first release!

This is the first usable version, providing only the minimal amount of features.
A lot of the value contained is a fully automated system for quality assurance
and deployment, which will help keeping the releases coming.
